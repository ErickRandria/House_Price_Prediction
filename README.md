## üéØ Overview

This project aims to predict California housing prices using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes various factors that influence housing prices and provides accurate predictions for median house values in different California districts.

**Key Objectives:**
- Explore and analyze the California housing dataset
- Implement data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Train and evaluate multiple regression models
- Compare model performances and select the best performing algorithm
- Create visualizations to understand data patterns and model results

## üìä Dataset

The project uses the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn, which contains information collected from the 1990 California census.

**Dataset Details:**
- **Samples:** 20,640 districts
- **Features:** 8 numerical features
- **Target:** Median house value (in hundreds of thousands of dollars)

**Features Description:**
- `MedInc`: Median income in block group
- `HouseAge`: Median house age in block group
- `AveRooms`: Average number of rooms per household
- `AveBedrms`: Average number of bedrooms per household
- `Population`: Block group population
- `AveOccup`: Average number of household members
- `Latitude`: Block group latitude
- `Longitude`: Block group longitude

## ‚ú® Features

- **Data Exploration:** Comprehensive exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- **Data Preprocessing:** Feature scaling, handling missing values, and outlier detection
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new meaningful features from existing ones
- **Multiple Models:** Implementation of various regression algorithms
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance comparison using multiple metrics
- **Visualization:** Interactive plots and maps showing predictions vs actual values
- **Cross-validation:** Robust model validation techniques
